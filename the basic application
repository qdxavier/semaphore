The semaphore is mainly used for sync and commnunication between threads or between process.
There are two versions sempaphore, one is system V, the other is POSIX.

The APIs of system V is as below:
semctl()
semget()
semop()

The APIs of POSIX is as below:
sem_getvalue()
sem_post()
sem_timedwait()
sem_try_wait()
sem_wait()

sem_destroy()         
sem_init()            //无名信号量， used in thread sync commonly

sem_close()           //有名信号量， used in process sync commonly
sem_open()
sem_unlink()

example:

#include "semaphore.h"
#include "fcntl.h"

sem_t *sem;
if((sem == sem_open("my_sem", O_CREAT, 0666, 1)) == SEM_FAILED)
{
  return -1;
}

sem_post(sem);
sem_wait(sem);
